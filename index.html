        LANGLEY, VA - A report released Tuesday by the CIA's office of the Inspector
        General revealed that the CIA has mistakingly obscured thousands of pages of
        critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
        <br><br>
        According to the report, section of the documents - "almost invariably the 
        most crucial passages" - are marred by an indelible ink that renders the lines 
        impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began in 1947.
        <br><br>
        CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably
        never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>the Cold War</li>
            <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
